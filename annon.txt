DESCRIPTION
talking to client we had several leaking fittings, got him to shut down power to fuel pumps and observed leaks at 3 fittings. First i
verified for tightness, they were all 3 loose, i then put down diapers incase of spillage and loosened fittings completely and cleaned
threads, then tightened fittings to proper torque and had him restart pumps to verify no leakage, and there wasn't any leakage.
Then they had a probe the wanted removed and changed out of day tank, had power disconnected again from pumps and i removed
probe and replaced with new one and rewiring.
was having conversation with ATT rep and he asked if we could put a riser in for him to be able to stick the belly tank, so | confirmed
with client and he said go ahead, so went and purchased a nipple and cap and drilled hole in access panel for riser then attached riser.
Asked client if there was anything else we could do for him and he advice there was not. Got clients information and came back to
shop.
