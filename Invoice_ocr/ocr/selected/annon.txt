Karl,
I do not have a record in Curtis file that he was hurt on the job. Do you have any incident reports for this? The date on
this bill is from 2018? If you do not can you get with Curtis to see what this is for and provide me with paperwork to back
it up.

The following Additional Terms of Sale apply except to the extent they are contradicted elsewhere in this Agreement.
IMPORTANT WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY PROVISIONS ARE INCLUDED.
1. DEFINITIONS: The term “Seller” means the Stewart & Stevenson affiliate executing this Agreement; “Goods” means the machinery,
equipment and other tangible and intangible property along with associated labor, installation and commissioning provided by Seller; the
term “Services” means labor and associated parts provided by Seller to maintain, repair or recondition the property of Buyer; “Products”
means Goods and/or Services; and “Buyer” means the person to whom such Products are sold. Each of Buyer and Seller is a “Party.”
2. PRICE: All prices are in U.S. Dollars. Labor rates are subject to change without notice and apply from the time of dispatch of service
personnel until the earlier of their return or dispatch to another job. Unless expressly indicated herein, no amount is included in any price
for sales, use, privilege, excise or other taxes imposed on or measured by the gross receipts from the sale of Products. Buyer shall
promptly pay any such charge directly to the governmental authority assessing them or reimburse on demand any such charges paid by
Seller.
3. PAYMENTS: All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars, without offset, backcharge, retention or withholding of any kind. Any amounts
not paid when due will be subject to interest at the rate of 1¥2% per month, compounded, or the highest non-usurious rate permitted by
applicable law, whichever is less. Standard terms are Net 30 from invoice date unless otherwise approved by the Seller. ANY
PAYMENT INTENDED AS AN ACCORD AND SATISFACTION MUST BE DIRECTED TO “CREDIT MANAGER, STEWART &
STEVENSON, 55 Waugh Drive, Suite 800, HOUSTON, TX 77007.”
4. DELIVERY AND TITLE: Goods are sold Ex-works Seller’s facility (Incoterms® 2010), packed for domestic truck transportation,
and are delivered at the time Buyer is notified by Seller that the Goods are at Buyer's disposal. Seller may assess reasonable storage
charges based on the volume of the Goods, or store the Goods at a third-party site at Buyer’s sole risk and expense, if Goods are not
removed when delivered or if payments are not made when due. Services are delivered at the time they are performed. Title to Goods
transfers to Buyer on delivery, but Seller retains a security interest in the Goods until it receives full payment for the Goods.
5. ACCESS, PERMITS AND UTILITIES: In the event Services are to be performed at a site provided by Buyer, Buyer shall provide
Seller’s employees free and unobstructed access to the site. Buyer shall ensure safe working conditions, safe storage for Seller’s property,
and provide all necessary lifting equipment and utilities necessary to perform the Services. Buyer shall obtain all licenses, registrations,
and permits necessary for Seller to perform the Services.
6. ACCEPTANCE: All Products shall be finally inspected and accepted within thirty days after delivery. Failure of Buyer to provide
Seller with an itemized list of defects within such thirty days or to permit Seller a reasonable opportunity to correct any listed defects shall
be deemed acceptance of the Products. In the event of multiple shipments or extended Services, each individual shipment shall be
separately accepted and Services shall be periodically inspected and accepted. Buyer waives any right to reject Products that substantially
conform to their specifications and any right to revoke acceptance after such thirty day period.
7. FORCE MAJEURE: Seller shall have no liability for any failure to deliver the Goods to, or perform Services for, Buyer if such
failure arises from causes beyond the reasonable control of Seller, including without limitation, government actions, shortages of
materials, labor difficulties, fires, floods, acts of God and the effects of civil disobedience.
8. DELAYS. Delivery dates are estimates and may be adjusted to reflect circumstances beyond the control of Seller including without
limitation delayed performance of suppliers or carriers.
9. CHANGES: Seller reserves the right to change the details of any Goods provided that such change shall not impair the performance or
critical dimensions of such Goods.
10. ADDITIONAL COSTS: In addition to the purchase price, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any costs Seller incurs as a result of (a)
changes in the Products or delays in delivery requested by Buyer; (b) delays in delivery arising from Buyer’s failure to provide
information, drawings or materials; or (c) changes in the laws, codes, rules or regulations applicable to the Products after the date of this
Agreement.
11. LIMITED WARRANTY: Products may be or incorporate components manufactured by someone other than Seller. To the extent
such components are warranted by their original manufacturers, and to the extent that such warranties are assignable to Buyer, Seller
assigns to Buyer any rights and remedies it has relating to such components, and such warranties are the only warranties provided for those
components. Seller further agrees to perform any obligations of the original manufacturer under the manufacturer’s warranty to the extent
that such manufacturer authorizes Seller to perform such warranty obligations.
Seller warrants that it will correct any failure of the Goods to meet the performance specifications herein, or defects in Goods
manufactured or reconditioned or Services performed by it, latent or otherwise, of which it is notified in writing within the applicable
Notification Period, ex-works Seller’s facilities (Incoterms® 2010), or Seller will refund the purchase price of the defective Goods or
Services, at Seller’s sole discretion and as the exclusive remedy provided.
Notification Periods:
New Goods: within the sooner of 18 months of delivery of the Goods to Buyer or 12 months of the Goods first being placed into
service by the original end user.
Services or reconditioned Goods: within 3 months of the Services being performed by Seller or recondtioned Goods being
delivered to the Buyer.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
WORKMANLIKE PERFORMANCE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
20170113
Page 3 of 3
This Limited Warranty is extended only to Buyer. Buyer may assign this Limited Warranty only to the original end user of the Products. No
other assignment of this Limited Warranty is permitted without the express written consent of Seller and any attempted assignment without the
consent of Seller is void. Applicable statutes may expand this Limited Warranty.
12. INDEMNITY (INCLUDING FOR NEGLIGENCE): TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUYER HEREBY
AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES,
DAMAGES, INJURIES, CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DEMANDS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE
ATTORNEY FEES AND OTHER LEGAL EXPENSES) OF WHATSOEVER KIND AND NATURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THOSE ARISING FROM INJURY TO, OR ILLNESS OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON AND FOR ALL DAMAGE TO,
LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, (COLLECTIVELY, “LOSSES”), RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, USE, OPERATION OR CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS, ANY BREACH OF
WARRANTY OR THE FAILURE OF EITHER PARTY TO FULLY PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING IN OR FROM CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR PRODUCT
LIABILITY OR CAUSED OR OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SELLER, WHETHER SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT. This Indemnity Provision is a material part of this Agreement, supported by and in consideration of a
reduction in the purchase price. In this Indemnity Provision, “Seller” means Seller, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
agents, representatives, employees, subcontractors, invitees and licensees.
13. DEFAULT: On any material breach of this Agreement by Buyer, including without limitation any failure of Buyer to make payments
when due, each such being an event of default, Seller will be entitled to terminate this Agreement, to all remedies provided by law or equity,
including without limitation its direct damages measured by lost profits as a volume seller. Any non-refundable down payment required by
this Agreement is less than the amount of Seller’s damages in the event Buyer breaches its obligation to take delivery of Goods when tendered
or to pay in full any amounts due.
14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, RESERVOIR, POLLUTION, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, REVENUES, PROFITS
OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES, ARISING FROM THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF PRODUCTS, THE USE, OPERATION OR
CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS, ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR THE FAILURE OF EITHER PARTY TO FULLY
PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF A PARTY WAS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY
SUSTAINING SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN FOR A BREACH FAILS OF ITS
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR A BREACH IS TOTAL AND FUNDAMENTAL, AND EACH PARTY WAIVES THE APPLICATION
OF ANY DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES OR CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. SELLER’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR
ANY CLAIM BY BUYER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE CLAIM IS
BASED.
15. EXPORTS: Seller reserves the right to rescind this Agreement, without any liability of Seller to Buyer, if at any time it reasonably
believes that Products are intended to or will be shipped, exported or re-exported, directly or indirectly, to any country, person or other entity
in contravention of any laws, regulations or administrative orders of the United States or any other jurisdiction to which Seller is subject (a
“Contravening Export”). Any actual intention or attempt on the part of the Buyer to effect a Contravening Export will constitute a material
breach of this Agreement. Buyer is required to identify the end use, end user, and country of final destination for Products included in this
Agreement. Buyer warrants that, with respect to transactions related to this Agreement, it has not committed, and will not commit, any
violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other anti-corruption statute.
16. ASSIGNMENT: Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement, voluntarily or
involuntarily, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law or any other manner without the express written consent of the other,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld but without which any attempted or purported assignment or delegation is void. This Agreement
binds and benefits both Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns but does not confer any rights or remedies on any other
person.
17. WAIVER: The waiver by Seller of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent
breach of a like or different nature. The failure by Seller to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of that
provision.
18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, LEGAL PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES.
19. INTERPRETATION AND VENUE: The Parties waive the application of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of
Goods to this Agreement. The laws of the State of Texas (without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles) govern all matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement. Venue
for any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be in Harris County, Texas; and the Parties waive any claim of an inconvenient
forum. Section headings are provided for convenience only.
20. SURVIVAL. The warranty, indemnity, limitation of liability, dispute resolution and interpretation and venue provisions herein survive
the termination of this Agreement.
21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the Parties and incorporates any prior agreements or
understandings, whether written or oral, to the extent the Parties intend such to be incorporated. No writing henceforth exchanged between
the Parties will be effective to amend or supplement this Agreement, except that such writing expressly refers to this Agreement and is signed
by both Parties.

Generator 1 polisher tripping on high vacuum alarm.
Service Performed:
5/14/2020:
Met with Nick and Jim on site. Jim had already done significant troubleshooting. Test ran polisher in manual. Closed filter vent. Indicated
vacuum showed ~10" Hg. After about 5 minutes, vacuum crept up to ~10.5" Hg and system shutdown on high vacuum.
Operated generator 2 polisher in manual. Steady state vacuum showed ~10" Hg and operated without alarm. Swapped vacuum gauges
between units 1 & 2. Noted gauge removed from unit 1 while disconnected and body vented, showed 2 psig (by definition, a gauge not
connected to anything and its internals proper vented to atmosphere should indicate 0 psig). With the unit 2 compound gauge installed,
when attempting to run system, indicated vacuum was momentarily exceeding 12" Hg before shutting down on high vacuum.
Shut down polisher and opened piping at tank suction. Removed in-line check valve (serves no function with the foot valve installed).
Pulled foot valve and confirmed no foreign objects (e.g. a rag) in the area of the fuel pick up in the tank. Replaced in-line check with
straight section of pipe and closed up piping system.
Started polisher in manual again. Vacuum slowly built up to ~6" Hg and held steady. Observed filter bowl and confirmed fuel flow
(bubbles passing through and suction line refilled). Left system to operate for ~20 minutes while cleaning up tools and used absorbent
rags. After 20 minutes, polisher still operating at steady state vacuum of 6" Hg.
6/30/2020
Replaced polisher 1 top cover. Replaced polisher 2 compound gauge. Installed replacement check valve. Ran polisher 1 for ~15
minutes; new steady state vacuum of 8" Hg. Stopped polisher and let system stand for ~10 minutes; no signs of leakage where new
check valve installed.

Good morning Michelle,
Please find attached the invoice for the ISO surveillance audit 2.
This should be allocated to PO 1283647 line 6/7.
@QES Team: | have requested the final audit report, because I have not received it yet. Also, do remember to review the
internal audit training proposal. Next year (June 2021), we have the recertification audit, which is a very important
milestone and we have the time on our side to get experience and knowledge about our QMS system.
Best regards,
Gerben

Hi Kathy,
The kids are adjusting very well; the parents have a more challenging time. Yes, we can connect with old friends.
However, only with a limited amount of people. But that is fine.
Majority of the colleague are supposed to work from home since we are in a new wave of COVID. Unfortunately, this is
not over yet.
Yes, the invoice is ok to pay. This is a standard fee for this type of work.
Best regards,
Gerben

DESCRIPTION
talking to client we had several leaking fittings, got him to shut down power to fuel pumps and observed leaks at 3 fittings. First i
verified for tightness, they were all 3 loose, i then put down diapers incase of spillage and loosened fittings completely and cleaned
threads, then tightened fittings to proper torque and had him restart pumps to verify no leakage, and there wasn't any leakage.
Then they had a probe the wanted removed and changed out of day tank, had power disconnected again from pumps and i removed
probe and replaced with new one and rewiring.
was having conversation with ATT rep and he asked if we could put a riser in for him to be able to stick the belly tank, so | confirmed
with client and he said go ahead, so went and purchased a nipple and cap and drilled hole in access panel for riser then attached riser.
Asked client if there was anything else we could do for him and he advice there was not. Got clients information and came back to
shop.
