Karl,
I do not have a record in Curtis file that he was hurt on the job. Do you have any incident reports for this? The date on
this bill is from 2018? If you do not can you get with Curtis to see what this is for and provide me with paperwork to back
it up.

Sender: Customer Copy —
Page 2 of 3
The following Additional Terms of Sale apply except to the extent they are contradicted elsewhere in this Agreement.
IMPORTANT WARRANTY, LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY PROVISIONS ARE INCLUDED.
1. DEFINITIONS: The term “Seller” means the Stewart & Stevenson affiliate executing this Agreement; “Goods” means the machinery,
equipment and other tangible and intangible property along with associated labor, installation and commissioning provided by Seller; the
term “Services” means labor and associated parts provided by Seller to maintain, repair or recondition the property of Buyer; “Products”
means Goods and/or Services; and “Buyer” means the person to whom such Products are sold. Each of Buyer and Seller is a “Party.”
2. PRICE: All prices are in U.S. Dollars. Labor rates are subject to change without notice and apply from the time of dispatch of service
personnel until the earlier of their return or dispatch to another job. Unless expressly indicated herein, no amount is included in any price
for sales, use, privilege, excise or other taxes imposed on or measured by the gross receipts from the sale of Products. Buyer shall
promptly pay any such charge directly to the governmental authority assessing them or reimburse on demand any such charges paid by
Seller.
3. PAYMENTS: All payments shall be in U.S. Dollars, without offset, backcharge, retention or withholding of any kind. Any amounts
not paid when due will be subject to interest at the rate of 1¥2% per month, compounded, or the highest non-usurious rate permitted by
applicable law, whichever is less. Standard terms are Net 30 from invoice date unless otherwise approved by the Seller. ANY
PAYMENT INTENDED AS AN ACCORD AND SATISFACTION MUST BE DIRECTED TO “CREDIT MANAGER, STEWART &
STEVENSON, 55 Waugh Drive, Suite 800, HOUSTON, TX 77007.”
4. DELIVERY AND TITLE: Goods are sold Ex-works Seller’s facility (Incoterms® 2010), packed for domestic truck transportation,
and are delivered at the time Buyer is notified by Seller that the Goods are at Buyer's disposal. Seller may assess reasonable storage
charges based on the volume of the Goods, or store the Goods at a third-party site at Buyer’s sole risk and expense, if Goods are not
removed when delivered or if payments are not made when due. Services are delivered at the time they are performed. Title to Goods
transfers to Buyer on delivery, but Seller retains a security interest in the Goods until it receives full payment for the Goods.
5. ACCESS, PERMITS AND UTILITIES: In the event Services are to be performed at a site provided by Buyer, Buyer shall provide
Seller’s employees free and unobstructed access to the site. Buyer shall ensure safe working conditions, safe storage for Seller’s property,
and provide all necessary lifting equipment and utilities necessary to perform the Services. Buyer shall obtain all licenses, registrations,
and permits necessary for Seller to perform the Services.
6. ACCEPTANCE: All Products shall be finally inspected and accepted within thirty days after delivery. Failure of Buyer to provide
Seller with an itemized list of defects within such thirty days or to permit Seller a reasonable opportunity to correct any listed defects shall
be deemed acceptance of the Products. In the event of multiple shipments or extended Services, each individual shipment shall be
separately accepted and Services shall be periodically inspected and accepted. Buyer waives any right to reject Products that substantially
conform to their specifications and any right to revoke acceptance after such thirty day period.
7. FORCE MAJEURE: Seller shall have no liability for any failure to deliver the Goods to, or perform Services for, Buyer if such
ailure arises from causes beyond the reasonable control of Seller, including without limitation, government actions, shortages of
materials, labor difficulties, fires, floods, acts of God and the effects of civil disobedience.
8. DELAYS. Delivery dates are estimates and may be adjusted to reflect circumstances beyond the control of Seller including without
imitation delayed performance of suppliers or carriers.
9. CHANGES: Seller reserves the right to change the details of any Goods provided that such change shall not impair the performance or
critical dimensions of such Goods.
0. ADDITIONAL COSTS: In addition to the purchase price, Buyer shall reimburse Seller for any costs Seller incurs as a result of (a)
changes in the Products or delays in delivery requested by Buyer; (b) delays in delivery arising from Buyer’s failure to provide
information, drawings or materials; or (c) changes in the laws, codes, rules or regulations applicable to the Products after the date of this
Agreement.
1. LIMITED WARRANTY: Products may be or incorporate components manufactured by someone other than Seller. To the extent
such components are warranted by their original manufacturers, and to the extent that such warranties are assignable to Buyer, Seller
assigns to Buyer any rights and remedies it has relating to such components, and such warranties are the only warranties provided for those
components. Seller further agrees to perform any obligations of the original manufacturer under the manufacturer’s warranty to the extent
that such manufacturer authorizes Seller to perform such warranty obligations.
Seller warrants that it will correct any failure of the Goods to meet the performance specifications herein, or defects in Goods
manufactured or reconditioned or Services performed by it, latent or otherwise, of which it is notified in writing within the applicable
Notification Period, ex-works Seller’s facilities (Incoterms® 2010), or Seller will refund the purchase price of the defective Goods or
Services, at Seller’s sole discretion and as the exclusive remedy provided.
Notification Periods:
New Goods: within the sooner of 18 months of delivery of the Goods to Buyer or 12 months of the Goods first being placed into
service by the original end user.
Services or reconditioned Goods: within 3 months of the Services being performed by Seller or recondtioned Goods being
delivered to the Buyer.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
WORKMANLIKE PERFORMANCE OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
20170113
Page 3 of 3
This Limited Warranty is extended only to Buyer. Buyer may assign this Limited Warranty only to the original end user of the Products. No
other assignment of this Limited Warranty is permitted without the express written consent of Seller and any attempted assignment without the
consent of Seller is void. Applicable statutes may expand this Limited Warranty.
12. INDEMNITY (INCLUDING FOR NEGLIGENCE): TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BUYER HEREBY
AGREES TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS SELLER FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES,
DAMAGES, INJURIES, CLAIMS, CAUSES OF ACTION, LIABILITIES, DEMANDS AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE
ATTORNEY FEES AND OTHER LEGAL EXPENSES) OF WHATSOEVER KIND AND NATURE, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION THOSE ARISING FROM INJURY TO, OR ILLNESS OR DEATH OF ANY PERSON AND FOR ALL DAMAGE TO,
LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY, (COLLECTIVELY, “LOSSES”), RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE DELIVERY, INSTALLATION, USE, OPERATION OR CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS, ANY BREACH OF
WARRANTY OR THE FAILURE OF EITHER PARTY TO FULLY PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING IN OR FROM CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR PRODUCT
LIABILITY OR CAUSED OR OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLIGENT ACT OR OMISSION OF SELLER, WHETHER SOLE,
JOINT OR CONCURRENT. This Indemnity Provision is a material part of this Agreement, supported by and in consideration of a
reduction in the purchase price. In this Indemnity Provision, “Seller” means Seller, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
agents, representatives, employees, subcontractors, invitees and licensees.
13. DEFAULT: On any material breach of this Agreement by Buyer, including without limitation any failure of Buyer to make payments
when due, each such being an event of default, Seller will be entitled to terminate this Agreement, to all remedies provided by law or equity,
including without limitation its direct damages measured by lost profits as a volume seller. Any non-refundable down payment required by
this Agreement is less than the amount of Seller’s damages in the event Buyer breaches its obligation to take delivery of Goods when tendered
or to pay in full any amounts due.
14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, RESERVOIR, POLLUTION, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF USE, REVENUES, PROFITS
OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES, ARISING FROM THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF PRODUCTS, THE USE, OPERATION OR
CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS, ANY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR THE FAILURE OF EITHER PARTY TO FULLY
PERFORM THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF A PARTY WAS AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY
SUSTAINING SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN FOR A BREACH FAILS OF ITS
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR A BREACH IS TOTAL AND FUNDAMENTAL, AND EACH PARTY WAIVES THE APPLICATION
OF ANY DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES OR CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW. SELLER’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR
ANY CLAIM BY BUYER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE CLAIM IS
BASED.
15. EXPORTS: Seller reserves the right to rescind this Agreement, without any liability of Seller to Buyer, if at any time it reasonably
believes that Products are intended to or will be shipped, exported or re-exported, directly or indirectly, to any country, person or other entity
in contravention of any laws, regulations or administrative orders of the United States or any other jurisdiction to which Seller is subject (a
“Contravening Export”). Any actual intention or attempt on the part of the Buyer to effect a Contravening Export will constitute a material
breach of this Agreement. Buyer is required to identify the end use, end user, and country of final destination for Products included in this
Agreement. Buyer warrants that, with respect to transactions related to this Agreement, it has not committed, and will not commit, any
violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other anti-corruption statute.
16. ASSIGNMENT: Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement, voluntarily or
involuntarily, by merger, consolidation, dissolution, operation of law or any other manner without the express written consent of the other,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld but without which any attempted or purported assignment or delegation is void. This Agreement
binds and benefits both Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns but does not confer any rights or remedies on any other
person.
17. WAIVER: The waiver by Seller of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent
breach of a like or different nature. The failure by Seller to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of that
provision.
18. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, LEGAL PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS IT CONTEMPLATES.
19. INTERPRETATION AND VENUE: The Parties waive the application of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of
Goods to this Agreement. The laws of the State of Texas (without giving effect to its conflict of laws principles) govern all matters arising out
of or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, its validity, interpretation, construction, performance and enforcement. Venue
for any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be in Harris County, Texas; and the Parties waive any claim of an inconvenient
forum. Section headings are provided for convenience only.
20. SURVIVAL. The warranty, indemnity, limitation of liability, dispute resolution and interpretation and venue provisions herein survive
the termination of this Agreement.

Important definitions
Rotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to
operational conditions.
Demand charge: Many non-residential rates include a demand charge.
Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of eiectricity in any single
fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand
is measured in kilowatts (or kw). High demand is usually associated with
equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of
time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges.
Time-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and
evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices also change by season,
with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter,
Please do not mark in box. For system use only.
DWR bond charge: Recovers the cost of bonds issued by the Department of
Water Resources (DWR) to purchase power to serve electric customers during
the California energy crisis. DWR bond charges are collected on behalf of DWR
and do not belong to PG&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): Ensures that non-exempt
customers under PG&E's GT and ECR rate schedules or who purchase electricity
(generation) from non-PG&E suppliers pay their share of generation costs.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated
gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs,
and public-interest research and development.

Good morning Michelle,
Please find attached the invoice for the ISO surveillance audit 2.
This should be allocated to PO 1283647 line 6/7.
@QES Team: | have requested the final audit report, because I have not received it yet. Also, do remember to review the
internal audit training proposal. Next year (June 2021), we have the recertification audit, which is a very important
milestone and we have the time on our side to get experience and knowledge about our QMS system.
Best regards,
Gerben

Hi Kathy,
The kids are adjusting very well; the parents have a more challenging time. Yes, we can connect with old friends.
However, only with a limited amount of people. But that is fine.
Majority of the colleague are supposed to work from home since we are in a new wave of COVID. Unfortunately, this is
not over yet.
Yes, the invoice is ok to pay. This is a standard fee for this type of work.
Best regards,
Gerben

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD BY APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. OR ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES (“SELLER”) ARE EXPRESSLY SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW. ANY DIFFERENT OR ADDITIONAL TERMS OR CONDITIONS IN BUYER'S PURCHASE ORDER OR SIMILAR COMMUNICATION ARE OBJECTED TO
AND SHALL NOT BE BINDING ON SELLER UNLESS AGREED TO IN WRITING BY A SELLER CORPORATE OFFICER. BUYER'S ACCEPTANCE OF SHIPMENT OR PERFORMANCE AND/OR
PAYMENT FOR THE GOODS OR SERVICES CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF SELLER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
PRICE: Prices in effect at time of shipment of goods or performance of services shall prevail. All prices quoted by SELLER
are subject to correction or change without notice. Prices do not include freight, shipping, handling fees and/ or duties,
any present or future sales, use, excise, value-added or similar taxes. Where applicable, such taxes shall be billed as a
separate item and paid by Buyer. A standard shipping charge is applied to each invoice for goods to cover the material
preparation, packaging, freight and/or any additional costs associated with each shipment based on value and/or weight
of the shipment. Additional charges for local delivery may also apply. Export orders may be subject to other special pricing.
PAYMENT TERMS: Unless otherwise agreed in writing, terms of payment are thirty (30) days net, without setoff or
deduction, from date invoice was mailed or goods are delivered, whichever is earliest, if Buyer's credit has been approved prior
to sale. A late payment charge of 1 1/2% per month (an annual percentage rate of 18%) shall be charged on all past due
accounts and Buyer shall pay SELLER all costs incurred by it in collecting any past due account from Buyer, including, but
not limited to, all court costs and attorney's fees. However, if the foregoing charges exceed that rate which is the maximum
permitted by law, then such charges shall be calculated to be the highest allowable lawful rate. The remittance portion of the
invoice shall accompany payment. Alternatively, payments and other adjustments must reference the invoice number to
assure proper credit
CREDIT BALANCE: Any credit balance issued will be applied within one (1) year of its issuance. IF NOT APPLIED WITHIN ONE
{1) YEAR, THE BALANCE REMAINING SHALL BE CANCELLED, AND SELLER SHALL HAVE NO FURTHER LIABILITY EXCEPT
AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
DELIVERY: Unless otherwise noted, all domestic sales of goods are made f.o.b. point of shipment {Uniform Commercial
Code) and all international sales of goods are made EXW point of shipment Incoterms® 2010. In all cases, title shall pass upon
delivery and thereafter all risk of loss or damage shall be upon Buyer. Delivery dates given in advance of actual shipment of
goods or performance of services are estimates and shall not be deemed to represent fixed or guaranteed delivery dates.
Buyer shall notify SELLER of any nonconforming goods within a commercially reasonable time after Buyer becomes aware
of such nonconforming goods.
WARRANTIES: Goods are sold only with such warranties as may be extended by the manufacturer of the goods. Services
performed by third parties are subject only to those warranties extended by such third parties. For additional warranty
information, please review SELLER's Warranty Policy available at WWW.APPLIED.COM or upon request to SELLER. TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SELLER MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXCEPT AS
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE WARRANTY POLICY. Buyer is responsible for installation and use in accordance with
manufacturer's instructions. Goods are sold for commercial use only and are not intended for use by consumers. SELLER
personnel are not authorized to alter this policy. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any warranty it grants to its
customer.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: SELLER takes no responsibility for goods selection, operation, and use, regardless of any
recommendations or suggestions made by the SELLER. Buyer shall make selections based upon its own analysis with regard
to function, material compatibility, fitness for use or intended purpose, and goods ratings. Any such analysis, including testing,
shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer. Proper installation, operation, and maintenance are solely the responsibility of Buyer
or its customer. Any specifications listed in SELLER’s datasheets, catalog and website are for reference only and are subject

ANY GOODS OR SERVICES SUPPLIED HEREUNDER, OR THE SALE, RESALE, OPERATION OR USE OF GOODS,
WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR INDEMNITY) OR OTHER
GROUNDS, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE PRICE ALLOCABLE TO SUCH GOODS OR SERVICES OR PART THEREOF
INVOLVED IN THE CLAIM, REGARDLESS OF CAUSE OR FAULT. This limitation of liability reflects a deliberate and
bargained-for allocation of risks between SELLER and Buyer and constitutes the basis of the parties’ bargain, without which
SELLER would not have agreed to the price or terms of this agreement. SELLER shall not under any circumstances, be liable
for any labor charges without its prior written consent. SELLER SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT BE LIABLE WHETHER AS A
RESULT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT {INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR INDEMNITY) OR OTHER

with advice or other assistance regarding any goods or services supplied hereunder, or any system or equipment in which any
such goods may be installed, and which is not required pursuant to this agreement, the furnishing of the advice or assistance
will not subject SELLER to any liability, whether based on agreement, warranty, tort {including negligence or indemnity) or
other grounds. Buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any third party claims arising out of the use,
resale, or lease of said furnished goods or services.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: Each party will retain exclusive interest in and ownership of its intellectual property

could cause substantial harm to persons or property. If so used, SELLER disclaims any and all liability for any nuclear
damage, contamination or other damage or injury and Buyer shall indemnify and hold SELLER harmless from such liability
whether as a result of breach of contract warranty, tort (including negligence or indemnity) or other grounds. SELLER and

or performance shall be extended for a period equal to the time lost by reason of delay.
CHANGE IN BUYER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION: SELLER reserves the right by written notice to cancel any order or

trustee for Buyer, or (iv) the execution by Buyer of an assignment for the benefit of creditors. SELLER reserves the right to
suspend its performance until payment or adequate assurance of performance has been received. SELLER also reserves the
right to cancel Buyer's credit at any time for any reason. Buyer, in order to provide security for the payment of the full
price of goods furnished hereunder, grants SELLER a security interest in the goods and the proceeds thereof. Buyer agrees

filed at any time as a financing and/or chattel mortgage, in order to perfect SELLER’s security interest. SELLER may, in
its sole discretion require, and Buyer hereby grants to SELLER, a continuing purchase money security interest in all inventory,
equipment, and goods sold by SELLER to or for the benefit of Buyer, wherever located, and all accessions and goods and
all proceeds from the sale thereof, and all accounts and accounts receivable which may from time to time hereafter come
into existence during the term of this Security Agreement. SELLER'S purchase money security interest is explicitly limited to
outstanding obligations between SELLER and Buyer.
ASSIGNMENT OR DELEGATION: Buyer shall not assign, transfer or delegate, whether by operation of law or otherwise,
any or all of its duties or rights hereunder without SELLER'S prior written consent
WAIVER, CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION: The failure of either party to assert a right hereunder or to insist
upon compliance with any term or condition will not constitute a waiver of that right or excuse any subsequent nonperformance
of any such term or condition by the other party. All transactions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, United
States of America, excluding conflict of law rules. Any dispute with a party located in U.S. arising out of or relating to
transactions hereunder shall be brought only before any state or federal court with jurisdiction and venue over Cleveland, Ohio,
unless all such courts refuse to exercise jurisdiction and venue, and the parties hereby consent to exclusive jurisdiction in such
courts. Any claims brought by Buyer shall be escalated to senior management level within both organizations prior to Buyer
filing a lawsuit. Trial by jury is hereby waived. Any dispute with a party located outside of U.S. except actions by Seller for
nonpayment by Buyer of the purchase price of goods or services sold, shall be settled by binding arbitration in Cleveland, Ohio
under Ohio law administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on
the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrators will have the powers
a state court judge would have had if the matter had been filed in such court, including equitable powers, except for the
power to award punitive damages, which they shall not have. The provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS: Buyer recognizes the goods are utilized in many regulated applications and that from time
to time standards and regulations are in conflict with one another. SELLER makes no promise or representation that the
goods will conform to any federal, state or local laws, ordinances, regulations, codes or standards, except as particularly
specified and agreed upon, in writing as part of the agreement between Buyer and SELLER. SELLER prices do not
include the cost of any related inspections, permits or inspection fees,
SPECIAL TOOLS: Unless specifically agreed in writing by SELLER, and unless paid for by Buyer as shown on the invoice, all
special tools, dies, jigs, patterns, machinery and/or equipment needed by SELLER for the performance of this sale are, and
shall remain, the property of SELLER.
ORDER ACCEPTANCE: Buyer acknowledges that no order shall be deemed accepted unless and until it is verified and
accepted by SELLER, or any of its U.S. affiliates, subsidiaries and divisions, at a continental U.S. facility or at any of its
websites. Buyer further consents that submission of its order shall subject Buyer to the jurisdiction of the federal courts of
the United States of America and of the State where acceptance occurred in the United States of America.

DESCRIPTION
talking to client we had several leaking fittings, got him to shut down power to fuel pumps and observed leaks at 3 fittings. First i
verified for tightness, they were all 3 loose, i then put down diapers incase of spillage and loosened fittings completely and cleaned
threads, then tightened fittings to proper torque and had him restart pumps to verify no leakage, and there wasn't any leakage.
Then they had a probe the wanted removed and changed out of day tank, had power disconnected again from pumps and i removed
probe and replaced with new one and rewiring.
was having conversation with ATT rep and he asked if we could put a riser in for him to be able to stick the belly tank, so | confirmed
with client and he said go ahead, so went and purchased a nipple and cap and drilled hole in access panel for riser then attached riser.
Asked client if there was anything else we could do for him and he advice there was not. Got clients information and came back to
shop.

Important definitions
Rotating outage blocks are subject te change without advance notice due to
operational conditions.
Demand charge: Many non-residential rates include a demand charge.
Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of electricity in any single
fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand
is measured in kilowatts (or kW). High demand is usually associated with
equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of
time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges.
Time-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and
evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices atso change by season,
with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter.
Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behaf of the State of California Department
of Water Resources {DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior
to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California
energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to
DWR, not PG&E.
Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to
ensure that both PG&E customers and those who have left PG&E service to
purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for
electric generation resources that were procured by PG&E on their behalf.
‘Above market’ refers to the difference between what the Litility pays for electric
generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit
www.pge.com/cca.
Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that
enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and
mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers,
Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire
Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds.
The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a
separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and
does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on
behalf of the Special Purpose Entity.
Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated
gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs,
and public-interest research and development.

installed;
{b) Retained all alleged defective parts for inspection by Collicutt;

10. REPAIRS NOT COVERED
The Warranty provided above shall not apply to a rebuilt engine or power unit and any rebuilt parts used therein which in the opinion of Collicutt have been damaged as a
result of excessive loading, over or under speeding, heating, fire or abnormal combustion, ingestion of foreign materials, inadequate maintenance, misalignment, accident,
improper installations, improper storage, improper use or any other condition or event not within the control of Collicutt.
11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

liable for any personal injuries (including death} to any person or any other loss or damage, either direct, indirect or consequential, whether to the equipment into which
parts are installed or to any other property, whether or not caused or contributed to by any defect in parts or by any other cause or reason whatsoever. In addition, in no
case, shall Collicutt be liable for loss of use of the equipment into which parts are installed or loss of profits whether or not caused or contributed to by the negligence or
default of Collicutt.
12. INDEMNIFICATION
Except for damages caused by the negligence of Collicutt, Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold Collicutt harmless from all claims, actions, demands, loss and cases of
action arising from injury, including death, to any person, or damage to any property, when such injury or damage results in whole or in part from the acts or omissions of
Customer.
13. FORCE MAJEURE
The obligations of each party hereto in any capacity shall be suspended and it shall not be liable for damages during the time and to the extent that such a party is prevented
from complying with its obligations hereunder in part or in whole by strikes, lockouts, acts of God or the Queen's enemies, wars, laws, unavoidable accidents, delays in
